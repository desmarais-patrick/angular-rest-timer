# Rest Timer (with Angular)

A single-page application, SPA built with Angular 14, that displays a timer and
plays a sound tone to help setup continuous reminders to rest and move while
at the computer.

See the first version with React here:

## Development server

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
